# 📝 Text Summarization using BART (TensorFlow + Keras)

This project demonstrates how to perform abstractive text summarization using the BART transformer model with TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes the pretrained `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face Transformers for generating concise and meaningful summaries from longer text inputs.

## ✅ Features

- 🔁 Encoder-decoder architecture using BART
- 🤗 Uses `facebook/bart-large-cnn` from Hugging Face
- 🧠 Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- 📝 Supports inference for long documents
- 💡 Can be fine-tuned on custom datasets
- 🎛️ Easily extendable for other seq2seq tasks
